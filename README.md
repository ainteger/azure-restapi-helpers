# Azure RestApi helpers

Headers in Azure Rest Api is a pain! Since I believe there are a lot of you out there that hates configuration and just want to add things to the storage account, I open sourced this repository. 

This repository is inspired by https://github.com/cmfaustino/PROMPT11-10-Cloud-Computing.cmfaustino/tree/master/Storage_REST_CS/Storage_REST/StorageSampleREST. This repo really saved me a lot of headache.

The repository will be updated with more methods when I need them, please feel free to create pull requests with missing parts.

The repository is built with ASP.NET Core.
